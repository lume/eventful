// TODO, make strongly typed event args. Combine with stuff in Events.ts (or similar).

// TODO, Make sure emit will not attempt to call event handlers removed

// will try to access undefined after the end of the array). Possibly use

/**
 * @mixin
 * @class Eventful - An instance of Eventful emits events that code can
 * subscribe to with callbacks. Events may optionally pass a payload to the
 * callbacks.
 *
 * Callbacks can be associated with contexts to be called with (called with
 * Function.prototype.call), which offers more performance than similar
 * patterns that don't allow contexts to be specified (in those cases the user
 * has to create new arrow functions or function clones with
 * Function.prototype.bind, which is heavier).
 *
 * For example, suppose some object `rectangle` emits events named "resize".
 * One can react to those events by subscribing to them with a callback:
 *
 * ```js
 * const onResize = size => {
 *   // whenever `object` emits a "resize" event, the event passes a payload
 *   // containing the new size of `object`:
 *   console.log(size) // for example, {x: 123, y: 123}
 * }
 *
 * rectangle.on("resize", onResize)
 * ```
 *
 * To stop reacting to the "resize" event later, we can unsubscribe the
 * callback from the "resize" events:
 *
 * ```js
 * rectangle.off("resize", onResize)
 * ```
